# pycc: A simple C compiler for x86 written in Python.

Teaching myself how to write a lexer, recursive descent parser, and x86 code generator, step-by-step.

My aim is not to produce a high-performance compiler, but to learn compiler construction and hopefully provide a helpful and highly legible reference for others who are learning.

* Lexer: complete, except for typedef handling
* Parser: work in progress
* Codegen: not started
* Macro Pre-processor: still deciding if I want to attempt this
